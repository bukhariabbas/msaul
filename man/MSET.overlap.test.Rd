\title{For four character vectors (list1, list2, background1, background2), this function computes a randomization-based p-value of the overlap.
It can test for either overrepresentation or underrepresention.}
\usage{
MSET.overlap.test(list1, list2, background1, background2, B = 30000,
  representation = "over")
}
\arguments{
\item{list1}{the first test list}

\item{list2}{the second test list}

\item{background1}{the background for the first list}

\item{background2}{the background for the second list}

\item{representation}{Test for overrepresentation or underrepresentation? Defaults to "over".}
}
