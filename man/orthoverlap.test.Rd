\title{Orthogroup test for over- or underrepresentation}
\usage{
orthoverlap.test(list1.s1, list2.s2, orthodb.index.s1, orthodb.index.s2,
  B = 30000, representation = "over", save.distribution = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{list1.s1}{the first test list from species 1}

\item{list2.s2}{the second test list from species 2}

\item{orthodb.index.s1}{a data frame indexing IDs from list 1 to OrthoDB IDs}

\item{orthodb.index.s2}{a data frame indexing IDs from list 2 to OrthoDB IDs}

\item{B}{the number of randomizations to perform (defaults to 30000)}

\item{representation}{test for overrepresentation or underrepresentation (defaults to "over")}

\item{save.distribution}{write out distribution to output (defaults to FALSE)}
}
\description{
For four character vectors (list1.s1, list2.s2, orthodb.index.s1, orthodb.index.s2), this function computes a randomization-based p-value of the overlap.
It can test for either overrepresentation or underrepresention.
Orthoverlap uses a normal approximation of the hypergeometric distribution to make scores from different distributions directly comparable.
It calculates the p-value by comparing the Pearson correlation coefficient derived from data with orthology to a sample with orthology bootstrapped.
